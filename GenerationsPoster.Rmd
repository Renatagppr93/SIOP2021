# Introduction

Popular press, consultative white papers, and trade publications frequently highlight unique generational differences that are important to accommodate if organizations hope to achieve a wide range of valuable organizational outcomes (see, for example, the presentations of Forbes, 2018; PWC, 2011).

Becton and colleagues (2014) suggest that such perceptions of generational differences may be more strongly attributed to popular culture rather than proper social science, and that generational differences may be less influential on organizational behaviors than is suggested within the broader popular culture.

King et al. (2019) note that generational effects tend to be quite small, and this is supported via meta-analytic investigation of organizational outcomes across generations (Costanza et al., 2012).

A generational cohort is a group of people who are identified by birth year range (Ryder, 1965). In a meta-analysis on generational differences in work attitudes, Constanza et al. (2012) summarized the boundaries of cohort years for empirical studies. They suggest that even though names are generally agreed upon, the boundary definitions across investigations vary. For the purposes of this presentation we utilize the PEW research group;s categorization of generations (see Table1). 


## Objectives

The current paper seeks to extend our field’s understanding of the intergenerational workplace by approaching the question of generational differences from a novel angle – by documenting time spent on different categories of activities as indicated via purposeful random sampling. 


# Methods

This package uses the same workflow approach as the R Markdown you know and love. Basically it goes from RMarkdown > Knitr > Markdown > Pandoc > HTML/CSS > PDF. You can even use the bibliography the same way [@R-posterdown].

# Results

Usually you want to have a nice table displaying some important results that you have calculated. In `posterdown` this is as easy as using the `kable` table formatting you are probably use to as per typical R Markdown formatting.

You can reference tables like so: Table \@ref(tab:mytable). Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam placerat augue at velit tincidunt semper. Donec elementum porta posuere. Nullam interdum, odio at tincidunt feugiat, turpis nisi blandit eros, eu posuere risus felis non quam. Nam eget lorem odio. Duis et aliquet orci. Phasellus nec viverra est.

```{r mytable, out.width='80%'}
knitr::kable(iris[1:10, 1:4], caption = 'Table caption.',align = 'c',"html")
```

Or with figures: Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot), or Figure \@ref(fig:morefigs).

```{r standard-plot, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Great figure!', fig.height=5}
plot(mtcars[1:2])
```

```{r morefigs, out.width='80%', echo=TRUE, fig.cap='Amazing, right?!', fig.height=5}
data <- iris

plot(x = data$Sepal.Length, 
     y = data$Sepal.Width, 
     col = data$Species,
     pch = 19, 
     xlab = "Sepal Length (cm)",
     ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)")

```

# Next Steps

Aliquam sed faucibus risus, quis efficitur erat. Vestibulum semper mauris quis tempus eleifend. Aliquam sagittis dictum ipsum, quis viverra ligula eleifend ut. Curabitur sagittis vitae arcu eget faucibus. In non elementum felis. Duis et aliquam nunc. Nunc pulvinar sapien nunc, vel pretium nisi efficitur in. Fusce fringilla maximus leo et maximus. Fusce at ligula laoreet, iaculis mi at, auctor odio. Praesent sed elementum justo. Aenean consectetur risus rhoncus tincidunt efficitur. Praesent dictum mauris at diam maximus maximus [@R-posterdown].

# Conclusion

Try `posterdown` out! Hopefully you like it!

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c('knitr','rmarkdown','posterdown','pagedown'), 'packages.bib')
